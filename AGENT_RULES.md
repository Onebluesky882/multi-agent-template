AGENT_RULES.md

Status: ACTIVE

Owner: CONDUCTOR

⸻

Purpose

Defines worker behavior, execution boundaries, compliance requirements, and governance protections. All workers must follow these rules.

Violation → Default Violation Rule in GOVERNANCE_CORE.md (Status: FAIL, Ready For Next Stage: NO).

⸻

Governance Protection

See GOVERNANCE_CORE.md for the governance file ownership table. Workers may NOT modify any governance file. Only Dev and Conductor may, per that table.

⸻

Worker Scope

Each worker owns one stage, one branch, one domain. Workers may not execute tasks outside assigned scope.

Workers MUST operate inside the worktree assigned to their stage. Running outside the assigned worktree is a scope violation. See PIPELINE.md — Worktree Rule.

⸻

Main Branch Merge Authority

Agents may NOT create, rename, delete, or re-point the main branch. `main` is owned exclusively by Dev.

⸻

Domain Ownership

Workers may only modify files inside their assigned domain. Cross-domain changes require explicit Conductor approval.

⸻

Technology Stack Authority

DECISIONS.md is authoritative. Workers must use approved technologies and must NOT replace frameworks, libraries, databases, authentication systems, or infrastructure without Conductor approval.

⸻

Version Policy — MANDATORY

Workers must use the latest stable version of every package unless the package appears in the **Pinned Versions** table in DECISIONS.md.

If a package is pinned: use the exact version in that table. Do NOT upgrade, downgrade, or substitute. Do NOT run `@latest` for pinned packages.

**Workers may NOT rely on memory or training data for version numbers** — versions known at training time are outdated. Always verify at runtime.

Before installing any package, run the appropriate check:

```bash
# npm
npm info <package> version

# pip
pip index versions <package>

# cargo
cargo search <package>
```

Bootstrap commands must always use `@latest`:

```bash
npm create vite@latest
npx create-expo-app@latest
npx create-next-app@latest
```

Violations that result in Status: FAIL:
* installing a package without running the version check above
* using a pinned version not declared in DECISIONS.md Pinned Versions table
* ignoring a pinned version and using @latest instead
* bootstrapping from a template without `@latest`
* claiming "latest" without evidence from the check command

Workers must include the verified version number in `dependencies_added` in gate-out.

⸻

Dependencies

Prefer existing dependencies. If a new dependency is required, document in gate-out.md: package, version, reason. See SECURITY_RULES.md for supply chain and security requirements.

⸻

Testing Rules

Required: build verification, unit tests, type checks. Workers may not claim tests passed unless executed.

⸻

Error Handling

Applications must fail gracefully. Return structured errors. Never intentionally crash systems.

⸻

Sub-Agent Restriction

Workers may NOT create, dispatch, or generate new workers or autonomous agents, delegate tasks, or create recursive execution chains. Only the Conductor may create workers.

⸻

Security Rules

See SECURITY_RULES.md for all security requirements (secrets, access control, data, network, APIs, dependencies, cryptography, infrastructure, CI/CD).

⸻

Build Artifact Rules

Never commit: `node_modules/`, `dist/`, `build/`, `.next/`, `target/`, `vendor/`, `__pycache__/`, `.venv/`. Verify `.gitignore` before push.

⸻

Stage Completion

Worker must create `gate-out/stage-[N]-<domain>.md` using this template:

```
stage_id:
status:                    # PASS | FAIL
ready_for_next:            # YES | NO
modified_files:
tests_run:
dependencies_added:        # package, version, reason — or "none"
acceptance_criteria:       # list each criterion: PASS | FAIL
known_issues:              # or "none"
risks:
blockers:
recommendations:
```

All fields are required. Empty fields must be explicitly set to "none" or "N/A".

⸻

Final Rule

Workers execute. Conductor decides. Governance overrides implementation.
